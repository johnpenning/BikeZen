# DockSmart
##Your live-updating, worldwide bike sharing companion.
##Never get dockblocked again.
====

DockSmart is the worldwide bike share companion app that tracks dock availability as you bike. No app is better at simply getting you to your destination as quickly and efficiently as possible.

Have you ever been dockblocked? You know the problem. You're out using your city's bike share system, and as you get to your destination, you notice that the station is completely full. There are no docks available for your bike, even though your phone told you there was a dock free when you first started biking. Someone stole your spot!

DockSmart uses station tracking to keep track of real-time station data while you're biking. Just tap Start Station Tracking and put your phone in your pocket. As you bike, DockSmart will periodically check if the station you're currently biking towards has filled up. If so, it will alert you with a buzz and a chime (make sure the ringer is on), telling you to go to the next closest station and saving you the effort of biking all the way to a station that just hit 100% capacity. If a dock at a closer station that was previously full opens up, it will alert you of that too.

DockSmart will also tell you when you've arrived. It uses region monitoring (or "geofences"), so when you're approaching your destination, you'll get an alert, so you know to keep your eyes peeled for the station. Background location services are only used when station tracking is active. Station tracking will stop automatically when you arrive. If you want to manually turn off tracking, simply tap Stop Station Tracking from the map screen.

DockSmart is incredibly easy to use. Simply type in an address, or point to one on the map using the center cursor and tap Set Destination. Based on your current location, DockSmart will tell you exactly where to pick up a bike and where to drop it off. If the closest station to your destination is full, it will guide you to the next closest one automatically.

DockSmart is compatible with bike sharing systems in over 170 cities worldwide. Your city's bike sharing system is automatically selected based on your current location. If you would like to manually select a different city, you can do so in the Settings app.
